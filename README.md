# Implementation and optimization of a calculation with DLX assembly code

DLX assembly classwork. This program consists of two implementations of code that outputs the result of the following matrix operations:
```
M = (A x B) · 1/|A + B| + k·C
```
where all A, B and C are 3x3 matrices and k is a real number.
The first implementation is a "natural" solution. The second version is an improved-performance version that takes advantage of pipelining.
  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
